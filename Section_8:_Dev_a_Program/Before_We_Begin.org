** About Libraries

*** Normal Libaraies: What we build
- Preprocessed, Require Compilation (.o), link (.exe, no suffix)

*** [[file:~/Documents/My_Cpp_Path/Section_10:_Bonus/AboutBonusContent.org::13][Static (link) Libraries:]] Files with C++ code
+ Compiled into a binary file (static Library), which we can link to our program to create an executable with code pre compiled in it
+ Can point to Dynamic Library
+ In Different OS:
  + Windows: `XYZ.lib`
  + Unix: `libXYZ.a`

*** Dynamic Library: Finds Code at runtime
+ Contains code the program finds while running (eg, cout)
+ In Different OS:
  + Windows: `XYZ.dll`
  + Unix: `libXYZ.so`
    + Mac exclusive: `XYZ.dylib`

** LIBSDL: Simple DirectMedia Layer
*** What it is:
+ A cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.
+ Also uses Dynamic Libraries, though its also possibl eto link this with static libraries, which is why we often need installets
  + But we dont need to worry about it as we just have 3 main files
    - =Header=
    - =Static Library= to link =Dynamic Library=
*** Installing Via: https://www.libsdl.org
**** Refer to Library Type to identify  the type of file we may need
**** In Linux:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Fedora: sudo dnf install SDL2-devel
Debian: sudo apt install libsdl2-devel
#+END_SRC
