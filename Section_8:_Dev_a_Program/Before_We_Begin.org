* About Libraries

* * Normal Libaraies: What we build
- Preprocessed, Require Compilation (.o), link (.exe, no suffix)

* * Static (link) Libraries: Files with C++ code
- Compiled into a binary file (static Library), which we can link to our program to create an executable with code pre compiled in it
- Can point to Dynamic Library
- In Different OS:
  + Windows: `XYZ.lib`
  + Unix: `libXYZ.a`

* * Dynamic Library: Finds Code at runtime
- Contains code the program finds while running (eg, cout)
- In Different OS:
  + Windows: `XYZ.dll`
  + Unix: `libXYZ.so`
    - Mac exclusive: `XYZ.dylib`
